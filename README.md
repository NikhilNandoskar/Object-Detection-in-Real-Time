# Object-Detection-in-Real-Time
In this project, I have made use of Google's Tensorflow Object Detection API. The code was then modified using OpenCV in order to capture real-time frames. I used a pre-trained Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model in my application. The future task is to integrate voice notes to call out detected objects by the model in real time.
